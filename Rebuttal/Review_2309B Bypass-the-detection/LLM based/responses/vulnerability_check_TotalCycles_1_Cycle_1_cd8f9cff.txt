Tested Code:

def code_execution(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        first_name = request.POST.get('first_name', '')
        #BAD -- Allow user to define code to be run.
        exec("setname('%s')" % first_name)

Cycle_1_response:
[Code Injection] : By using the exec function with user-supplied input in the form of first_name, the code is vulnerable to Code Injection. An attacker can provide malicious input including Python code as part of the 'first_name' parameter, which could be detrimental to the application.
