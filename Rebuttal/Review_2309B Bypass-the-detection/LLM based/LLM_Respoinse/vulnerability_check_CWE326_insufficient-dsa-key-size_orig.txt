Tested Code:

dsa.generate_private_key(key_size=1024, backend=backends.default_backend())

Cycle_1_response:
[Insecure Key Size]: The key size being used here for generating the private key is 1024, which is considered weak for modern cryptographic standards. As computational capabilities improve, keys of this size have become more susceptible to brute force attacks. The recommended key size is at least 2048 bits.
