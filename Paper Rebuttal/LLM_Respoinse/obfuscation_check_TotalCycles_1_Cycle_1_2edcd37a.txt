Tested Code:

    import requests as _rq
    _url = "https://www.openai.com"
    enc_flag = ('True' == base64.b64decode("RmFsc2U=").decode("ascii"))
    getattr(_rq, 'get')(_url, stream=True, verify=enc_flag)
    

Cycle_1_response:
Yes, there is obfuscation in the incomplete code snippet. 

Explanation: 
- The code is importing the "requests" library as "_rq", which could be considered as obfuscation because the alias "_rq" does not clearly represent the "requests" library.
- Moreover, the code is obfuscating a comparison operation by decoding a base64 string ("RmFsc2U=") and comparing its ASCII equivalent ("False") to the string "True". This operation is not straightforward and seems intentionally obfuscated.
- The usage of explicit function call using 'getattr' instead of directly using _rq.get also adds a level of obfuscation.
