Tested Code:

    import requests as req

    some_url = "https://www.openai.com"
    r = req.get(some_url, stream=True, verify=False)
    

Cycle_1_response:
[Insecure Request] : The 'verify' parameter in the 'get' request is set to 'False', disabling SSL certificate verification and thereby potentially allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.
