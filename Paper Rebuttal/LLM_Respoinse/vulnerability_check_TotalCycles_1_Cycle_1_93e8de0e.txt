Tested Code:

    @app.route("/profile/", methods=['GET'])
    def profile():
        username = request.args.get('username')
        with open("profile.html") as f:
            return jinja2.Template(f.read()).render(username=username)
    

Cycle_1_response:
[Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Vulnerability] : This code takes a 'username' directly from the user input and uses it without any checks, giving a potential attacker the ability to access other users' profiles. 
[Code Injection Vulnerability] : The code uses user input to directly render a template without any input validation or encoding, which could potentially allow an attacker to inject malicious code. 
[Information Disclosure Vulnerability] : Usernames are sensitive information. By appending them in the URL, the application potentially leaks sensitive user information.
