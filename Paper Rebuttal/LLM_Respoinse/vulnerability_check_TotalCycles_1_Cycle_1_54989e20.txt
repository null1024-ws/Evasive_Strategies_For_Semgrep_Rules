Tested Code:

    @app.route('/user_picture2')
    def user_picture2():
        base_path = '/server/static/images'
        filename = request.args.get('p')
        data = open(os.path.join(base_path, filename), 'rb').read()
        return data
    

Cycle_1_response:
[Path Traversal Vulnerability] : This code is potentially vulnerable to a path traversal attack, as it directly uses user input (through 'filename') to access a file without verifying the input. An attacker could manipulate 'filename' to navigate through the file system and access sensitive files.
